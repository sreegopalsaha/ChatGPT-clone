# ChatGPT Clone

Welcome to the ChatGPT Clone project! This project aims to replicate the functionality of the ChatGPT website, providing an interface where users can interact with an AI powered by the ChatGPT API.

## Project Overview

This clone closely resembles the ChatGPT website, allowing users to input text and receive responses from an AI model. The AI model is powered by the ChatGPT API, which generates responses based on the input provided by the user.

### Features

- **Chat Interface:** Users can input text into the chat interface, and the AI will respond accordingly.
- **Sidebar:** The sidebar stores the history of chats, allowing users to refer back to previous conversations.
- **Local Storage:** Chat history is stored in the local storage of the browser, ensuring that users can access their chat history even after refreshing the page.

## About

As a newcomer to JavaScript, I've put in my best effort to write clean, efficient, and reusable code for this project. While I'm still learning, I'm eager to continue working on this project to improve its functionality and fix any bugs that may arise.

## Future Plans

- **Responsiveness:** One of my future goals is to make this web page responsive, ensuring that it looks and functions well across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Bug Fixes:** I'm aware that there are still many bugs in the project that need to be addressed. I'll continue to work on fixing these bugs to improve the overall user experience.
- **Enhancements:** In addition to bug fixes, I plan to add new features and enhancements to make the ChatGPT Clone even more useful and user-friendly.
- **Animations:** I plan to add animations to enhance the user experience. Animations will make the interface more engaging and visually appealing, providing a smoother interaction for users.

## Getting Started

To use this project:

1. Replace `Enter your apiKey` with your actual OpenAI API key in the index.js file.
2. Modify the database to include the data that you want the AI to be knowledgeable about.
3. Run the project locally or deploy it to a web server to start interacting with the AI.

## Contributions

Contributions to this project are welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests with bug fixes, new features, or improvements to the codebase.

Thank you for your interest in the ChatGPT Clone project!
